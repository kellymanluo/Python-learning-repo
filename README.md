# Python-learning-repo

Why Did I decide to learn Python?
What is the most important skill of a computer scientist? The most important skill is problem solving. Problem solving is the ability to discover problems, think creatively about solutions, and express solutions clearly and accurately. Practice has proved that the process of learning programming is an excellent opportunity to train problem-solving skills. 

I have no computer background. I take the challenge to learn Python by myself starting from September 10th, 2021.
